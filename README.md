# Bank Loan Prediction 
This project aims to build a predictive model for bank loan approvals using machine learning techniques. It includes data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.

Applied data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Built multiple classification models including:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Conducted hyperparameter tuning and used cross-validation to improve model accuracy.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy among all models tested.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to support automated decision-making in financial institutions.
